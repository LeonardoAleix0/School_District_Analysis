# **PyCitySchool District Analysis**

## Overview of Project

This projectâ€™s objective is to prepare standardized analysis, reporting insights, trends and patterns to support strategic decisions at the school and district level. The metrics covered in this analysis are below:

* The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
* The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
* Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
* School performance based on the budget per student
* School performance based on the school size 
* School performance based on the type of school

## Data Source Information
The data source was divided in two tables, the student dataset and the school dataset. The student dataset provided information regarding the students such as student name, school name, math and reading scores and grades. The school dataset was composed of school name, type (District or Charter), size (student number) and budget. The tables were joined by the student id to provide a complete analysis of this dataset.

## Software
Python 3.7.6, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook

## Data cleaning
The column student name presented a number of prefixes that were removed, a change was also made to the 9th grade students from Thamos High School that had their reading and math scores replaced by a non value character as per request due to improper information.

## Results 

The school project is composed of 15 schools in which 7 schools are classified as District with the remaining schools classified as Charter. The total number of students is 39170 students and the total budget is $24,649,428.00. 

### District summary

The district summary had a drop of 1.1% in the math and reading score average and passing percentage with the change requested regarding Thomas High school. The columns Total Students and Total Budget maintained its original values.
